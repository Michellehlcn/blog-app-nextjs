                    <hr/>
                    <p>The hotspots have been variously defined as areas of elevated incidence or prevalence, higher transmission efficiency or risk, or higher probability of disease emergence. To define whether that area is a hotspot is a complex matter, however, this map was based on the HCDCâ€™s declaration which ordered the closure of suburbs immediately in order to control transmission and mitigate further spread.</p>
                    <p>Disclaimer: This is my personal work with no affiliation to any organisation. Data was based on the website: hcdc.vn. Since the number of Covid19 cases has seen risen within Hochiminh City and in Vietnam as a whole, the occurrence of a case of infection in the community with a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) and opportunities for wide community exposure, I devoted myself to this page in order to help local folks in navigation of hotspots, bringing out any necessary restriction. It is an urgent task and absolutely needs everyone collaboration.</p>
